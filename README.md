# Extended Kalman Filtering for Airborne Wind Energy Systems

This script processes flight data and applies an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the state of a kite system. The code is written in Python and utilizes the pandas library for data handling, casadi for symbolic operations and NumPy for numerical operations.
