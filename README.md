# Extended Kalman Filtering for Airborne Wind Energy Systems

This script processes flight data and applies an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the state of a kite system. The code is written in Python and utilizes the pandas library for data handling, casadi for symbolic operations and NumPy for numerical operations.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ocayon/Vortex-Step-Method
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```bash
    cd Vortex-Step-Method
    ```
    
3. Create a virtual environment:
   
   Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    
    Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    
5. Activate the virtual environment:

   Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Windows
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

6. Install the required dependencies:

   For users:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
        
   For developers:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

7. To deactivate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
